Transformadores, estimadores y tuberías\n\nTres conceptos importantes en el aprendizaje automático de MLlib que se ilustran en este notebook son **Transformers**, **estimadores** y **Pipelines**.\n\n- **Transformer**: Toma un DataFrame como entrada y devuelve un nuevo DataFrame. Los transformadores no aprenden ningún parámetro de los datos y simplemente aplican transformaciones basadas en reglas para preparar los datos para el entrenamiento del modelo o generar predicciones usando un modelo MLlib entrenado. Llamas a un transformador con un método `.transform ()`.\n\n- **Estimador**: aprende los parámetros del DataFrame a través de un método `.fit ()` y devuelve un modelo, que es un transformador.\n\n- **Pipeline**: combina varios pasos en un solo flujo de trabajo que se puede ejecutar fácilmente. La creación de un modelo de aprendizaje automático generalmente implica configurar muchos pasos diferentes e iterar sobre ellos.

El conjunto de datos incluye características categóricas como educación, ocupación y estado civil.\n\nEl siguiente bloque de código ilustra cómo usar `StringIndexer` y` OneHotEncoder` para convertir variables categóricas en un conjunto de variables numéricas que solo toman los valores 0 y 1.\n\n- `StringIndexer` convierte una columna de valores de cadena en una columna de índices de etiquetas. \n- 'OneHotEncoder` mapea una columna de índices de categoría a una columna de vectores binarios, con como máximo un \"1\" en cada fila que indica el índice de categoría para esa fila.\n\nLa codificación one-hot en Spark es un proceso de dos pasos. Primero usa StringIndexer, seguido de OneHotEncoder. El siguiente bloque de código define StringIndexer y OneHotEncoder pero aún no lo aplica a ningún dato."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b085060b-d530-4b1f-a322-f01e602caa3d"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder\n\ncategoricalCols = [\"workclass\", \"education\", \"marital_status\", \"occupation\", \"relationship\", \"race\", \"sex\"]\n\n# The following two lines are estimators.
